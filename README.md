Smart Parking System Simulation - MATLAB
Project Description

This project simulates a Smart Parking System using MATLAB, designed to monitor and manage the occupancy of parking spaces within a parking lot. The system keeps track of available and occupied parking spots as vehicles enter or leave the lot.

The simulation models the process of inserting and removing vehicles, automatically updating the occupancy status of each parking space in real-time. The system also incorporates LED indicators, which visually display the availability of parking spots.
Key Features

    Parking Space Monitoring: Tracks which parking spaces are occupied and which are free.
    Vehicle Insertion & Removal Simulation: Simulates cars entering and exiting specific parking spaces.
    Real-Time Status Updates: As vehicles are added or removed, the system updates the parking lot map and the corresponding space status.
    LED Indicator System: Each space has an LED indicator â€”
        Green LED: Space is free.
        Red LED: Space is occupied.
    Dynamic Visualization: The MATLAB interface visually represents the parking lot, allowing users to see the current status of all spaces.

Technologies Used

    MATLAB: Simulation coding, logic implementation, and visualization.
